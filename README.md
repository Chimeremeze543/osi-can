# OSI-CAN Website redesign (Group D)

## Summarized project background and business needs/ opportunities:

The project that we are supposed to redesign and work on with our client is the website Osi-Can. Which is an operational stress injury and PTSD support initiative in Canada, created in 2016. It aims to aid those who suffer from stress, PTSD or any injury that they endured while working in their profession. According to their website they stated that their mission is to “inspire hope and contribute to the continuous well-being and recovery process of Veterans, Community First Responders and Public Safety Personnel.” and that their vision is to empower and encourage the targeted groups to strive for recovery and resilience.
When we had our first check in meeting with our client he gave us an overview and showed us the website we are to work on and develop. He emphasized on the idea that he wanted the website to be easily navigated and searched through. In our project we aim to make the website as user friendly and efficient as possible. We also aim to make it easy to navigate and use for users. As well, we aim to improve user experience with the website, in designing it in a way where it is easy for the targeted group to use and all other users as well.
To accomplish our aims there are some things that we will need, such as a software to design our new improved vision of the website, as well as many meetings with our client to discuss new ideas, changes and ways in which we can accomplish our aims.

## Northstar and carryover customers:

Northstar customers: are the ideal customers for a certain project or business idea. The northstar customers for our project are individuals such as veterans, first responders and public safety personnel who struggle with PTSD and or stress. Our project should provide them with the appropriate resources to help them heal from these struggles. People from the work sector include: doctors, firefighters, police officers and so much more.
Carryover customers: that can include the family members of the targeted demographic. In addition, donors and volunteers.

## Project assumptions:

Resources: one of the assumptions is that we have to use the software Wordpress in order to accomplish our goals, aims and design our project there.
Only the targeted group will view our project: the internet is such a large and huge place where anyone can view anything nowadays, therefore we have to assume that the only people to use our project are the targeted group. This is because we have to identify a targeted group and build our project accordingly.
Requirements: we are supposed to meet the requirements set by our customer in the way in which we design and create our own version of the website.

## Project Constraints:

Resources: one of the most important restrictions is that we are restricted to use Wordpress as our main software for design.
Time: we are limited and constricted by a certain time frame in which we have to meet our goals and tasks within.
Client’s requirements: we are restricted by clients requirements in terms of how things should be done and presented, in the design and logistics of the project.
Information constraints: the only available resources for us on the topic of the project and on the charity’s aims and goals are what is presented on the website.
Skill level: most of our group members are somewhat beginners in this matter and in this scope of field, therefore our level of skill is limited.
