## Overview

In this section, we present our prototypes that helped us shape the project design and gather useful feedback.

## Why Lo-Fi Prototypes

We created these **lo-fi prototypes** because they are **efficient and fast** to make.  
The main goal was to quickly validate ideas and **get feedback from customers** without investing too much time in high-fidelity designs at this early stage.

Additionally, these prototypes emphasize **understanding & discoverability** because of their **simpler layout and cleaner design**, which improves the **pickup of information** and helps users engage more effectively with the product.

### Parsa Mozouni

Before creating my prototypes, I aimed to make them clear and easy for anyone to understand. I designed the wireframes for the main OSI-CAN webpages using paper and pencil, focusing on simplicity, affordance, and Gestalt principles. I tried to be efficient and create a fast, clean design that clearly shows the structure and layout of each page. This approach helped me focus on how users would navigate and understand the overall flow of the website.

### Bushra Alkhateeb

Before I made my prototype, I had one goal in mind: that anyone who views my prototype can understand to a certain level what I am trying to communicate. This is why I made these three sets of criteria for myself when creating the prototypes:

1. **Simplicity:** I tried to make the prototype as simple and generic as possible. Aside from the fact that I am not the best artist ever, I tried to simplify what the user will see on each page when using the application. I tried to capture the important things such as where I believe certain texts should go, where pictures should be placed, as well as where the menu should be and how it should look on every page.

2. **Affordance:** This is the concept that properties or elements of the prototype should give an idea of how they will be used. This concept was implemented in my prototype as I shaded buttons so that they look like they could be clickable and used. I also made it clear where a picture and where text is supposed to be.

3. **Gestalt Feature:** This is the concept that humans perceive things as wholes, not parts. I tried to implement this in my design; when designing every page, I made sure there was a logo icon at the top. I also tried to include any main features I wanted to be present on every page, such as the menu bar, so that the viewer can view things as a whole, not as separated parts.

### Abrianna Primavera

The Events page prototype showcases the Gestalt principle of enclosure. All the images for the different events are enclosed in their own spaces. This helps to cleanly group the related images and to separate the different events. It also makes it possible to display multiple events on the same page in a more organized way. The dropdowns on the target demographic prototypes are also examples of this.

### Chimeremeze Richmond

For the first activity, I have designed low-fidelity wireframe prototypes for the six primary webpages I have narrowed down for an OSI-CAN revamped website: Home Page, Programs/Events Page, Contribute Page, About Us Page, Publications Page, and Contact Us Page. In designing these low-fidelity wireframes, I carefully considered three concepts in People-Centred Design: affordances, signifiers, and constraints.

Affordances refer to the relationship between the properties of a design and the capabilities of a user. In other words, the possible actions a client can take with a design, be it a physical product or an online site. For each of the prototypes, I’ve ensured that prospective users can read and view content as well as navigate the site via link-embedded text in the menu bar and footer, and also link buttons in the main body of the webpage. Of course, these are basic affordances for any website, including OSI-CAN's current website. What differentiates my design from the current OSI-CAN website is that all text-related content will be text rather than being photographed or screen-grabbed. This will allow more avenues for copying text (an affordance in itself), which is essential when conducting research or referencing resources. In addition to navigation and viewing content, I’ve augmented the site with the affordance of web search via the search bar in the website’s header.

Signifiers are visual and, at times, auditory means of identifying where a user can take action on a product. For my wireframes, I’ve implemented about three signifiers. One being the search icon and text in the search bar, another being a menu selection cursor, and finally, webpage button icons. The search icon tells the user that the white bar in the header is meant for carrying out searches, the cursor tells the user that the menu text items are webpage links; the cursor’s position varies depending on the webpage the user is currently on, and the button icons indicate where the user can navigate to another page on the main body of the site.

Constraints refer to the limitations of one’s resources when designing a project. For the project encompassing this activity, my team will mainly be constrained by time and the software we are assigned to use (WordPress). Due to limited time and I’m a beginner with the application, I’ve come up with a wireframe design that’s simple but elegant and efficient.
