# User Story Map (USM)

## Overview

This document provides a **User Story Map (USM)** for our project.  
The map shows how features are grouped into **activities** (broad categories), **goals** (user needs), and **MVP releases** (priorities across phases).  
It helps the team align on the product journey and plan incremental releases.
