## The Process

This section describes the overall design and development process followed in this project.  
It covers initial research, ideation, and iterative steps toward the final solution.

## Customer notes

Written below are the summarized notes given to us by Julius Brown, the executive
director of OSI-CAN Saskatchewan, during our first customer check-in:

- He said “okay” to there being a donate button next to the menu.
- He said that it is okay to change the entire structure of the home page. He said
  “absolutely.”
- Told us the home page needs to be less overwhelming.
- To make things less overwhelming, he mentioned: changing the current menu into
  a vertical menu on the side (said it is “cleaner”), adding a search function, listing
  things from most important to least important.
- Mentioned the psychology of website menus and how in English people read from
  left to right. This can influence the placement and organization of menus.
- Said “Okay” to a donate section.
