# Affinity Diagram

## Overview

This Affinity Diagram was created by our team to help OSI-CAN better understand users and guide design priorities.
We organized insights and ideas into clusters, grouping them into Target Demographic, Features, Design, and User Navigation.
By doing this, we can clearly see common themes, reduce complexity, and highlight the areas that matter most for improving OSI-CAN’s website and overall user experience.
